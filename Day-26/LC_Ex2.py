'''You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain 
the even numbers from the list numbers.

DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

Example Output
[2, 8, 34]

# Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:

result = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(result)
